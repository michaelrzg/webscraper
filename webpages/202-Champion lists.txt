Champion lists
 
The idea of champion lists (sometimes also called fancy lists or top docs) is to precompute, for each term  in the dictionary, the set of the  documents with the highest weights for ; the value of  is chosen in advance. For tf-idf weighting, these would be the  documents with the highest tf values for term . We call this set of  documents the champion list for term .


Now, given a query  we create a set  as follows: we take the union of the champion lists for each of the terms comprising . We now restrict cosine computation to only the documents in . A critical parameter in this scheme is the value , which is highly application dependent. Intuitively,  should be large compared with , especially if we use any form of the index elimination described in Section 7.1.2 .  One issue here is that the value  is set at the time of index construction, whereas  is application dependent and may not be available until the query is received; as a result we may (as in the case of index elimination) find ourselves with a set  that has fewer than  documents.  There is no reason to have the same value of  for all terms in the dictionary; it could for instance be set to be higher for rarer terms.
