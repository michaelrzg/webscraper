Classification with more than two classes
 
We can extend two-class linear classifiers to
 classes. The method to use
depends on whether the classes are mutually exclusive
or not.


Classification for classes that are not mutually exclusive
is called  any-of ,  multilabel , or  multivalue classification .  In this
case, a document can belong to several classes
simultaneously, or to a single class, or to none of the
classes.  A decision on one class leaves all options open
for the others.  It is sometimes said that the classes are
independent of each other, but this is misleading
since the classes are rarely statistically independent in
the sense defined on page 13.5.2 .  In terms
of the formal definition of the classification problem in
Equation 112 (page 112 ), we learn 
different classifiers  in any-of classification,
each returning either  or 
:

.


 
Solving an any-of classification task with linear
classifiers is straightforward:


Build a classifier for each class,
where the training set consists of the set of documents in
the class (positive labels) and its complement (negative
labels). 

Given the test document, apply each
classifier separately. The decision of one classifier has no
influence on the decisions of the other classifiers.



The second type of classification with more than two classes
is 
 one-of classification . Here, the classes are
mutually exclusive.
Each document must belong to exactly one of
the classes. 
One-of classification is also called
 multinomial ,
 polytomous ,
 multiclass ,
or
 single-label classification .
Formally, there is a single classification function  in
one-of classification whose range is , i.e.,

.
kNN is a (nonlinear) one-of classifier.


True one-of problems are less common in text classification
than any-of problems.  With classes like UK,
China, poultry, or coffee, a
document can be relevant to many topics simultaneously - as
when the prime minister of the UK visits China to talk about
the coffee and poultry trade.


Nevertheless, we will often make a one-of assumption, as we
did in Figure 14.1 , even if classes are not
really mutually exclusive. For the classification problem of
identifying the language of a document, the one-of
assumption is a good approximation as most text is written
in only one language. In such cases, imposing a one-of constraint
can increase the classifier's effectiveness because errors
that are due to the fact that the any-of classifiers
assigned a document to either no class or more than one class are eliminated.

 hyperplanes do not divide 
 
into 
distinct regions as illustrated in Figure 14.12 . Thus, we must use
a combination method when using two-class linear classifiers for one-of classification.
The simplest method is to rank classes
and then select the top-ranked
class. Geometrically, the ranking can be with
respect to the distances from the  linear separators.
Documents close to
a class's separator are more likely to be misclassified, so the
greater the distance from the separator, the more plausible
it is that a positive classification decision is correct.
Alternatively, we can use a direct measure of confidence to
rank classes, e.g., probability of class membership.
We can state this algorithm
for one-of classification with linear classifiers
as follows:



Build a classifier for each class,
where the training
set consists of the set of documents in the class (positive labels) and its
complement (negative labels).

Given the test document, 
apply each classifier separately.

Assign the document to the class with


the maximum score,

the maximum confidence value,

or the maximum probability.

A confusion matrix for Reuters-21578.For example, 14 documents from
grain were incorrectly assigned to wheat.
Adapted from Picca et al. (2006).

 



An important tool for analyzing the performance of a 
classifier for  classes is the  confusion matrix . The
confusion matrix shows for each pair of classes 
, how many
documents from  were incorrectly assigned to . In
Table 14.5 , 
the classifier manages to distinguish the three
financial classes money-fx,
trade, and
interest from the three agricultural classes
wheat,
corn, and
grain, but makes many errors within these two
groups. 
The confusion matrix can help pinpoint opportunities
for improving 
the accuracy of the system. For example, to address the
second largest error in Table 14.5  (14 in the row grain), one could attempt to
introduce features that distinguish wheat documents
from grain documents.


Exercises.

Create a training set of 300 documents, 100 each
from three different languages (e.g., English, French,
Spanish). Create a test set by the same procedure, but also add
100 documents from a fourth language. 
Train (i) a one-of
classifier (ii) an any-of
classifier on this training set and
evaluate it on the test set.
(iii) Are there any interesting
differences in how the two classifiers behave on this task?
