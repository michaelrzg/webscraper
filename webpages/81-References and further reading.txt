The practical pursuit of computerized information retrieval began in the
late 1940s
(Cleverdon, 1991, Liddy, 2005).
A great increase in the production of scientific literature, much in
the form of less formal technical reports rather than traditional
journal articles, coupled with the availability of computers, led to
interest in automatic document retrieval.  However, in those days,
document retrieval was always based on author, title, and keywords;
full-text search came much later.


The article of Bush (1945) provided lasting inspiration for the
new field:

``Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of
mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one
at random, `memex' will do. A memex is a device in which an individual
stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is
mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and
flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.''


The term Information Retrieval was coined by Calvin Mooers in
1948/1950 (Mooers, 1950).


In 1958, much newspaper attention was paid to demonstrations at a
conference (see Taube and Wooster, 1958) of IBM ``auto-indexing''
machines, based primarily on the work of H. P. Luhn.
Commercial interest quickly
gravitated towards Boolean retrieval systems, but the early years saw a
heady debate over various disparate technologies for retrieval
systems.  For example Mooers (1961) dissented:

``It is a common fallacy, underwritten at this date by
  the investment of several million dollars in a variety of retrieval
  hardware, that the algebra of George Boole (1847) is the appropriate
  formalism for retrieval system design. This view is as widely and
  uncritically accepted as it is wrong.''


The observation of AND vs. OR giving you opposite extremes
in a precisionrecall tradeoff, but not the middle ground comes
from (Lee and Fox, 1988).


The book (Witten et al., 1999) is the standard reference for an in-depth
comparison of the space and time efficiency of the inverted index versus
other possible data structures; a more succinct and up-to-date presentation appears in
Zobel and Moffat (2006).  We further discuss several approaches
in Chapter 5 .


Friedl (2006) covers the practical usage of  regular
  expressions  for searching.  The underlying computer science appears
in (Hopcroft et al., 2000).
