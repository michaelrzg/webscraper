Tiered indexes
 
We mentioned in Section 7.1.2  that when using heuristics such as index elimination for inexact top- retrieval, we may occasionally find ourselves with a set  of contenders that has fewer than  documents.  A common solution to this issue is the user of  tiered indexes , which may be viewed as a generalization of  champion lists .  We illustrate this idea in Figure 7.4 , where we represent the documents and terms of Figure 6.9 .  In this example we set a tf threshold of 20 for tier 1 and 10 for tier 2, meaning that the tier 1 index only has postings entries with tf values exceeding 20, while the tier 2 index only has postings entries with tf values exceeding 10.  In this example we have chosen to order the postings entries within a tier by document ID.




Tiered indexes.If we fail to get  results from tier 1, query processing ``falls back'' to tier 2, and so on.  Within each tier, postings are ordered by document ID.
