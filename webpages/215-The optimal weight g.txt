The optimal weight g


We begin by noting that for any training example  for which 
 and 
, the score computed by Equation 14 is . In similar fashion, we may write down the score computed by Equation 14 for the three other possible combinations of  and ; this is summarized in Figure 6.6 .




Figure 6.6:
The four possible combinations of  and .




Let  (respectively, ) denote the number of training examples for which 
 and 
 and the editorial judgment is Relevant (respectively, Non-relevant).  Then the contribution to the total error in Equation 17 from training examples for which 
 and 
 is






(18)


By writing in similar fashion the error contributions from training examples of the other three combinations of values for  and  (and extending the notation in the obvious manner), the total error corresponding to Equation 17 is






(19)



By differentiating Equation 19 with respect to  and setting the result to zero, it follows that the optimal value of  is

Exercises.

When using weighted zone scoring, is it necessary for all zones to use the same Boolean match function?



In Example 6.1.1 above with weights 
 and , what are all the distinct score values a document may get?



Rewrite the algorithm in Figure 6.4 
to the case of more than two query terms.



Write pseudocode for the function WeightedZone for the case of two postings lists in Figure 6.4 .



Apply Equation 20 to the sample training set in Figure 6.5  to estimate the best value of  for this sample.



For the value of  estimated in Exercise 6.1.3, compute the weighted zone score for each (query, document) example.  How do these scores relate to the relevance judgments in Figure 6.5  (quantized to 0/1)?



Why does the expression for  in (20) not involve training examples in which  and  have the same value?
