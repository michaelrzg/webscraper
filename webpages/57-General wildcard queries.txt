General wildcard queries
 We now study two techniques for handling general wildcard queries. Both techniques share a common strategy: express the given wildcard query  as a Boolean query  on a specially constructed index, such that the answer to  is a superset of the set of vocabulary terms matching . Then, we check each term in the answer to  against , discarding those vocabulary terms that do not match . At this point we have the vocabulary terms matching  and can resort to the standard inverted index.
