System issues


There are many practical benchmarks on which to rate an information
retrieval system beyond its retrieval quality.  These include:


How fast does it index, that is, how many documents per hour does it
  index for a certain distribution over document lengths?
(cf. Chapter 4 )

How fast does it search, that is, what is its latency as a
  function of index size?

How expressive is its query language?  How fast is it
  on complex queries?

How large is its document collection, in terms of the number of
  documents or the collection having information distributed across a
  broad range of topics? 


All these criteria apart from query language expressiveness are
straightforwardly measurable: we can quantify the speed or size.
Various 
kinds of feature checklists can make query language expressiveness
semi-precise.
