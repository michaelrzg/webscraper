Standard test collections


Here is a list of the most standard test collections and evaluation
series.  We focus particularly on test collections for ad hoc information
retrieval system evaluation, but also mention a couple of 
similar test collections for text classification.


The  Cranfield  collection. This was the pioneering test
collection in allowing
precise quantitative measures  of information retrieval effectiveness, but is nowadays too small for anything but the most elementary pilot experiments.
Collected in the United Kingdom starting in the late 1950s, it contains 
1398 abstracts of aerodynamics journal articles, a set of 225 queries,
and exhaustive relevance judgments of all (query, document) pairs.




 Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) .  The U.S. 
   National 
  Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) 
  has run a large IR test bed evaluation series since 1992.  Within this
  framework, there have been many tracks over a range of different test
  collections, but the best known test collections are the ones used for the 
  TREC Ad Hoc track during the first 8 TREC evaluations between
  1992 and 1999.  In total, these test collections comprise 6 CDs containing 1.89 million documents (mainly, but not exclusively, newswire articles) and relevance judgments for
  450 information needs, which are called  topics 
and specified in
detailed text passages.  Individual test collections are defined over
different subsets of this data. The early TRECs each consisted of 50
information needs, evaluated over different but overlapping sets of
documents. TRECs 6-8 provide 150 information needs over about 528,000
newswire and Foreign Broadcast Information Service articles.   
This is probably the best subcollection to use in future work, because
it is the largest and the topics are more consistent.
Because the test document collections are so
large, there are no exhaustive relevance judgments.  Rather, NIST
assessors' relevance judgments are available only for the documents
that were among the top  returned for some system which
was entered in the TREC evaluation for which the information need was
developed.


In more recent years, NIST has done evaluations on larger document
collections, including the 25 million page  GOV2  web page collection.
From the beginning, the NIST test document collections were orders of magnitude
larger than anything available to researchers previously and GOV2 is
now the largest Web collection easily available for research purposes. 
Nevertheless, the size of GOV2 is still more than 2 orders of magnitude
smaller than the current size of the document collections indexed by
the large web search companies. 




NII Test Collections for IR Systems ( NTCIR ). The NTCIR project
  has built various test collections of similar sizes to the TREC
  collections, focusing on East Asian language and  cross-language
  information retrieval , where queries are made in one language over
  a document collection containing documents in one or more other languages.  See:
  http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/data/data-en.html



Cross Language Evaluation Forum ( CLEF ).  This evaluation series
  has concentrated on European languages and cross-language information
  retrieval.  See: http://www.clef-campaign.org/



   and Reuters-RCV1. For text classification, the most
  used test collection has been the 
  Reuters-21578 collection of 21578 newswire articles; see Chapter 13 ,
  page 13.6 . 
  More recently, Reuters released the much larger Reuters Corpus
  Volume 1 (RCV1), consisting of 806,791 documents; see
  Chapter 4 , page 4.2 . Its scale and rich annotation makes it
  a better basis for future research.




 20 Newsgroups .   This is another
  widely used text classification collection, collected by Ken Lang.
  It consists of 1000 articles from each of 20 Usenet newsgroups (the
  newsgroup name being regarded as the category).  After the removal of 
  duplicate articles,
  as it is usually used, it contains 18941 articles.
