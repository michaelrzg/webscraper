Centroid clustering




In centroid clustering, the similarity of two clusters is
defined as the similarity of their centroids:








(207)
 



(208)
 



(209)


Equation 207  is centroid similarity. Equation 209 
shows that centroid similarity is equivalent to average
similarity of all pairs of documents from different
clusters. Thus, the difference between GAAC and centroid
clustering is that GAAC considers all pairs of documents in
computing average pairwise similarity 
(Figure 17.3 , (d))
whereas centroid
clustering excludes pairs from the same cluster
(Figure 17.3 , (c)).


Figure 17.11  shows the first three steps of a
centroid clustering. 
The first two iterations form the clusters
 with centroid  
and
 with centroid  
because the pairs
 
 and

 have the highest centroid similarities. In the
third iteration, the highest
centroid similarity is between  and  producing the
cluster 
 with centroid .


Like GAAC,
centroid clustering is not best-merge persistent and
therefore 
 (Exercise 17.10 ).






In contrast to the other three HAC algorithms,
centroid clustering is not monotonic. 
So-called 
 inversions 
can occur: Similarity can
increase during clustering as in the example in
Figure 17.12 , where we define similarity as negative distance.
In the first merge, the similarity of  and  is .
In the second merge, the similarity of the
centroid of  and  (the circle) and  is

. This is an example of an
inversion: similarity increases in this sequence of
two clustering steps. In a monotonic HAC
algorithm, similarity is monotonically decreasing
from iteration to iteration.


Increasing similarity in a series of HAC clustering steps
contradicts the fundamental assumption that small
clusters are more coherent than large clusters. An inversion
in a dendrogram shows up as a horizontal merge line that is
lower than the previous merge line.
All merge lines in
 and 17.5  are higher than
their predecessors because single-link and complete-link
clustering are monotonic clustering algorithms.


Despite its non-monotonicity, centroid clustering is often used
because its similarity measure - the similarity of two
centroids - is conceptually simpler than the average of all
pairwise similarities in GAAC. Figure 17.11  is all one needs to
understand centroid clustering. There is no equally simple
graph that would explain how GAAC works.


Exercises.

   For a fixed set of  documents there are up to 
distinct similarities between clusters in single-link and
complete-link clustering. How many distinct cluster
similarities are there in GAAC and centroid clustering?
