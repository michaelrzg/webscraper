Support vector machines and machine learning on documents


Improving classifier effectiveness has been an area of intensive
machine-learning research over the last two decades, and this work has
led to a new generation of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as support
vector machines, boosted decision trees, regularized logistic
regression, neural networks, and random forests.  Many of these methods,
including support vector machines (SVMs), the main topic of this chapter, have
been applied with success to information retrieval problems,
particularly text classification.  
An SVM
is a kind
of large-margin classifier: it is a
vector space based machine learning method where the goal is
to find a decision boundary between two classes that is 
maximally far from any point
in the training data (possibly discounting some points as outliers or noise).


We will initially motivate and
develop SVMs for the case of two-class data sets that are separable by a
linear classifier 
(Section 15.1 ), and then extend the model in
Section 15.2  to
non-separable data, multi-class problems, and nonlinear models,
and also present some additional discussion of SVM performance.
The chapter then moves to consider the practical deployment of text
classifiers in Section 15.3 : what sorts of classifiers are
appropriate when, and how can you exploit domain-specific text
features in classification?  Finally, we will consider how the machine
learning technology that we have been building for text classification
can be applied back to the problem of learning how to rank documents
in ad hoc retrieval (Section 15.4 ). While several machine
learning methods have been applied to this task, use of SVMs has been
prominent.    
Support vector machines are not necessarily better than other
machine learning methods (except perhaps in situations with little training data), but
they perform at the state-of-the-art level and have much current
theoretical and empirical appeal.
