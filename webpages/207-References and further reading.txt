Chapter 7  develops the computational aspects of
vector space scoring. Luhn (1957;1958) describes some of
the earliest reported applications of term weighting. His
paper dwells on the importance of medium frequency terms
(terms that are neither too commonplace nor too rare) and
may be thought of as anticipating tf-idf and related
weighting schemes. Spärck Jones (1972) builds on this intuition
through detailed experiments showing the use of inverse
document frequency in term weighting. A series of extensions
and theoretical justifications of idf are due to
Salton and Buckley (1987)
Robertson and Jones (1976), Croft and Harper (1979) and
Papineni (2001). Robertson maintains a web page
(http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ser/idf.html)
containing the history of idf, including soft copies of
early papers that predated electronic versions of journal
article.  Singhal et al. (1996a) develop pivoted document
length normalization. Probabilistic language models
(Chapter 11 ) develop weighting techniques that are
more nuanced than tf-idf; the reader will find this
development in Section 11.4.3 .


We observed that by assigning a weight for each term in a
document, a document may be viewed as a vector of term
weights, one for each term in the collection. The SMART
information retrieval system at
Cornell (Salton, 1971b) due to Salton and colleagues
was perhaps the first to view a document as a vector of
weights. The basic computation of cosine scores as described
in Section 6.3.3  is due to Zobel and Moffat (2006).
The two query evaluation strategies term-at-a-time and
document-at-a-time are discussed by Turtle and Flood (1995).


The SMART notation for tf-idf term weighting schemes in
Figure 6.15  is presented in
(Singhal et al., 1996b;1995, Salton and Buckley, 1988).  Not
all versions of the notation are consistent; we most closely
follow (Singhal et al., 1996b).  A more detailed and
exhaustive notation was developed in Moffat and Zobel (1998),
considering a larger palette of schemes for term and
document frequency weighting.  Beyond the notation,
Moffat and Zobel (1998) sought to set up a space of feasible
weighting functions through which hill-climbing approaches
could be used to begin with weighting schemes that performed
well, then make local improvements to identify the best
combinations.  However, they report that such hill-climbing
methods failed to lead to any conclusions on the best
weighting schemes.
