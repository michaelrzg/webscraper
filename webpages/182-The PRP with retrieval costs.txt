The PRP with retrieval costs


Suppose, instead, that we assume a model
of retrieval costs. Let  be the cost of not retrieving
a relevant document and  the cost of retrieval of a
nonrelevant document. Then the Probability Ranking
Principle says that
if for a specific document  and
for all documents  not yet retrieved






(62)


then  is the next document to be retrieved. Such a model gives a formal framework where we can model differential costs of false positives and false negatives and even system performance issues at the modeling stage, rather than simply at the evaluation stage, as we did in Section 8.6 (page ).  However, we will not further consider loss/utility models in this chapter.
