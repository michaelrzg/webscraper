The premier venue
for research on XML retrieval
is the  INEX  (INitiative
for the Evaluation of XML retrieval) program, a
collaborative effort that has produced reference collections,
sets of queries, and relevance judgments. A yearly INEX
meeting is held to
present and discuss research results.
The INEX 2002 collection consisted of about 12,000 articles from
IEEE journals. We give collection statistics  in
Table 10.2  and show
part of the schema of the collection in
Figure 10.11 . The IEEE journal collection was expanded
in 2005. Since 2006 INEX uses the much larger English
 Wikipedia  as a test collection. The relevance of
documents is judged by human assessors using the methodology introduced in
Section 8.1 (page ), appropriately modified for structured documents
as we will discuss shortly.


Two types of information needs or
  
in
INEX are content-only or CO topics and content-and-structure
(CAS) topics.  CO topics  are regular
keyword queries as in unstructured information retrieval.  CAS topics 
have structural constraints in addition to keywords.
We already encountered an example of a CAS
topic in
Figure 10.3 . The keywords in this case are
summer and holidays and the structural
constraints specify that the keywords occur in a section
that in turn is part of an article and that this article has
an embedded year attribute with value
2001 or 2002.


Since CAS queries have both structural and content criteria,
relevance assessments are more complicated than in
unstructured retrieval. INEX 2002 defined component
coverage and topical relevance as orthogonal
dimensions of relevance. The  component coverage  dimension
evaluates whether the element retrieved is ``structurally''
correct, i.e., neither too low nor too high in the tree. We
distinguish four cases:


Exact coverage (E). The information sought is
the main topic of the component and the component is a meaningful unit of information.

Too small (S). The information sought is the main
topic of the component, but the component is not a
meaningful (self-contained) unit of information.

Too large (L). The information sought is present in
the component, but is not the main topic.

No coverage (N). The information sought is not a topic
of the component.



The  topical relevance  dimension also has four levels: highly
relevant (3), fairly relevant (2), marginally relevant (1)
and nonrelevant (0).
Components are judged on both
dimensions and the judgments are then combined into a
digit-letter code.  2S is a fairly relevant component that
is too small and 3E is a highly relevant component that has
exact coverage.  In theory, there are 16 combinations of
coverage and relevance, but many cannot occur. For example,
a nonrelevant component cannot have exact coverage, so the
combination 3N is not possible.


The relevance-coverage combinations are quantized
as follows:






(54)


This evaluation scheme takes account of the fact that binary
relevance judgments, which are standard in unstructured
information retrieval (Section 8.5.1 , page 8.5.1 ), are not appropriate for XML
retrieval. A 2S component
provides incomplete information and may be difficult to
interpret without more context,
but it does answer the query partially. The quantization
function Q does not impose a binary choice
relevantnonrelevant and
instead allows us to grade the component as partially relevant.


The number of relevant components in a retrieved set  of
components can
then be computed as:






(55)


As an approximation, the standard definitions of precision,
recall and F from Chapter 8 
can be applied to this modified definition of
relevant items retrieved, with some subtleties
because we sum
graded as opposed to binary relevance assessments. See the
references on focused retrieval in Section 10.6  for further discussion.


One flaw of measuring relevance this way is that overlap is
not accounted for. We discussed the concept of marginal
relevance in the context of unstructured retrieval in
Section 8.5.1 (page ).  This problem is worse in XML retrieval
because of the problem of multiple nested elements occurring
in a search result as we discussed on
page 10.2 .
Much of the recent focus at
INEX has been on developing algorithms and evaluation
measures that return non-redundant results lists and evaluate
them properly. See the references in Section 10.6 .

Table 10.3  shows two INEX 2002 runs of
the vector space system we described in Section 10.3 .
The better run is the SIMMERGE run, which incorporates few
structural constraints and mostly relies on keyword
matching.  SIMMERGE's median average precision (where the
median is with respect to average precision numbers over
topics) is only 0.147.  Effectiveness in XML retrieval is often
lower than in unstructured retrieval since XML retrieval is
harder. Instead of just finding a document,
we have to find the subpart of a document that is most
relevant to the query.  Also, XML retrieval effectiveness -
when evaluated as described here - can be lower than
unstructured retrieval effectiveness on a standard
evaluation because graded judgments lower measured
performance.  Consider a system that returns a document with
graded relevance 0.6 and binary relevance 1 at the top of
the retrieved list. Then, interpolated precision at 0.00
recall (cf. page 8.4 ) is 1.0 on a binary evaluation, but can be as low as
0.6 on a graded evaluation.

Table 10.3  gives us a sense of the typical
performance of XML retrieval, but it does not
compare structured with unstructured retrieval.
Table 10.4  directly shows the effect of using
structure in retrieval. The results are for a
language-model-based system (cf. Chapter 12 ) that is
evaluated on a subset of CAS topics from INEX 2003 and
2004. The evaluation metric is precision at  as defined
in Chapter 8  (page 8.4 ). The
discretization function used for the evaluation maps 
highly relevant elements
(roughly corresponding to the 3E elements defined for
Q) to 1
and all other elements to 0. The content-only
system treats queries and documents as unstructured bags of
words.  The full-structure model ranks elements that satisfy
structural constraints higher than elements that do not. For
instance, for the query in Figure 10.3  an element
that contains the phrase summer holidays in a section
will be rated higher than one that contains it in an
abstract.


The table shows that structure helps increase precision at
the top of the results list. There is a large increase of
precision at  and at . There is almost no improvement
at . 
These results demonstrate the benefits of structured retrieval.
Structured retrieval imposes
additional constraints on what to return and documents that
pass the structural filter are more likely to be relevant. 
Recall may suffer because some
relevant documents will be filtered out, but for
precision-oriented tasks structured retrieval is superior.
