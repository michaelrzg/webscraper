Information retrieval system evaluation


To measure ad hoc information retrieval effectiveness in the standard way, we
need a test collection consisting of three things: 


A document collection

A test suite of information needs, expressible as queries

A set of relevance judgments, standardly a binary assessment of
  either relevant or nonrelevant for each query-document pair.


The standard approach to information retrieval system evaluation
revolves around the notion of  relevant  and
nonrelevant documents.  With respect to a user information need, a
document in the test collection is given a binary classification as either
relevant or nonrelevant. 
This decision is referred to as the   gold standard  or  ground truth  judgment of relevance.
The test document collection and suite of information needs have to be of a
reasonable size: you need to average performance 
over fairly large test sets, as results are highly
variable over different documents and information needs.  As a rule of
thumb, 50 information needs has usually been found to be a
sufficient minimum.


Relevance is assessed relative to an
  ,
not a query.  For example, an information need 
might be:

Information on whether drinking red wine is more
effective at reducing your risk of heart attacks than white wine.


This might be translated into a query such as:

wine and red and white and
heart and attack and effective


A document is relevant if it addresses the stated information need, not
because it just happens to contain all the words in the query.  This
distinction is often misunderstood in practice, because the information
need is not overt.  But, nevertheless, an information need is
present.  If a user types python into a web search engine, 
they might be wanting to know where they can purchase a pet python.  Or they
might be wanting information on the programming language Python.  From a
one word query, it is very difficult for a system to know what the
information need is.  But, nevertheless, the user has one, and can judge the returned
results on the basis of their relevance to it.  
To evaluate a system, we require an overt expression of an information
need, which can be used for judging returned documents as relevant or
nonrelevant.
At this point, we make a simplification: relevance can reasonably
be thought of as a scale, with some documents highly relevant and
others marginally so.  But for the moment, we will use just a binary
decision of relevance.  We discuss the reasons for using 
binary relevance judgments and alternatives in Section 8.5.1 .


Many systems contain various weights (often known as
parameters) that can be adjusted to tune system
performance. It is wrong to report results on a test
collection which were obtained by tuning these parameters to
maximize performance on that collection. That is because
such tuning overstates the expected performance of the
system, because the weights will be set to maximize
performance on one particular set of queries rather than for
a random sample of queries.  In such cases, the correct
procedure is to have one or more  development test
collections ,  and to tune the
parameters on the development test collection.  The tester
then runs the system with those weights on the test
collection and reports the results on that collection as an
unbiased estimate of performance.
