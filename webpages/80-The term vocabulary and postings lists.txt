The term vocabulary and postings lists


Recall the major steps in inverted index construction:


Collect the documents to be indexed.

Tokenize the text. 

Do linguistic preprocessing of tokens. 

Index the documents that each term occurs in.


In this chapter we first briefly mention how the basic unit of a
document can be defined and how the character sequence that it comprises
is determined (Section 2.1 ). We then examine
in detail some of the 
substantive linguistic issues of tokenization and linguistic
preprocessing, which determine the vocabulary of terms which a system uses
(Section 2.2 ).  Tokenization is the process of
chopping character streams 
into  tokens , while linguistic
preprocessing then deals 
with building equivalence classes of tokens which are the set of
 terms  that are 
indexed.  Indexing itself is covered 
in Chapters 1 4 .
Then we return to the implementation of postings lists.
In Section 2.3 , we examine an extended
postings list data structure that supports faster querying, while 
Section 2.4  covers building postings data structures suitable for 
handling phrase and proximity queries, of the sort that commonly appear in
both extended Boolean models and on the web.
