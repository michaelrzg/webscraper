Cardinality - the number of clusters

A difficult issue in clustering is determining the
number of clusters or 
 cardinality  of a clustering,
which we denote by .  Often  is nothing more than a good guess based
on experience or domain knowledge.  But for  -means, we will
also introduce a heuristic method for choosing  and an
attempt to incorporate the selection of  into the
objective function.  Sometimes the application puts
constraints on the range of .  For example, the
Scatter-Gather interface in Figure 16.3  could not
display more than about  clusters per layer because of
the size and resolution of computer monitors in the early 1990s.


Since our goal is to optimize an objective function,
clustering is essentially a search problem.  The brute force
solution would be to enumerate all possible clusterings and
pick the best.  However, 
there are exponentially many 
partitions, so this approach is not
feasible. For this reason, most flat
clustering algorithms refine an initial partitioning
iteratively.  If the search starts at an unfavorable initial
point, we may miss the global optimum. Finding a good
starting point is therefore another important problem we
have to solve in flat clustering.
