A first take at building an inverted index


To gain the speed benefits of indexing at retrieval time, we
have to build the index in advance.  The major steps in this are:


Collect the documents to be indexed:



 ...

Tokenize the text, turning each document into a list of tokens:

 


 
 ...

Do linguistic preprocessing, producing a
  list of normalized tokens, which are the indexing terms:

 


 
 ...

Index the documents that each term occurs in by creating an inverted index,
  consisting of a dictionary and postings.


We will define and discuss the earlier stages of processing, that is,
steps 1-3,
in Section 2.2 (page ).  Until then you can
think of tokens and normalized tokens as also loosely equivalent to
words.
Here, we assume that the first 3 steps have already been done, and we
examine building a basic inverted index by
 sort-based indexing .






Within a document collection, we assume that each document
has a
unique serial number, known as the document identifier
 ( docID ). During index construction, we can simply
assign successive integers to each new document
when it is first encountered.
The input to indexing is a list of normalized
tokens for each document, which we can equally think of as a list of
pairs of term and docID, as in Figure 1.4 .  The core indexing
step is 
 sorting 
this list so that the terms are alphabetical,
giving us the representation in the middle column of
Figure 1.4 .  Multiple occurrences of the same term from the
same document are then merged.Instances of the same term are then grouped, and the result is split
into a  dictionary  and
 postings , as shown in the right column of
Figure 1.4 .  Since
a term generally occurs in a number of
documents, this data organization already reduces the storage requirements of
the index.  The dictionary also records some statistics, such as the
number of documents
which contain each term (the  document frequency , which is here
also the length of each postings list).  This information is not
vital for a basic Boolean search engine, but it allows us to
improve the efficiency of the search engine at query time, and it
is a statistic later used in many ranked retrieval models.
The postings are secondarily sorted by docID.  This provides the basis
for efficient query processing.
This inverted index structure is essentially without rivals as
the most efficient structure for supporting ad hoc text search.


In the resulting index, we pay for storage of both
the dictionary and the postings lists.
The latter are much larger, but the dictionary is commonly kept in memory,
while postings lists are normally kept on disk, so the size of each is
important, and in Chapter 5  we will examine how
each can be optimized for storage and access efficiency.
What data structure should be used for a postings list?  A fixed length
array would be wasteful as some words occur in many documents, and others
in very few.
For an in-memory postings list, two good alternatives are singly linked
lists or variable length arrays.  Singly linked lists allow cheap
insertion of documents into postings lists (following updates, such as
when recrawling the web for updated documents), and naturally extend to
more advanced indexing strategies such as skip lists
(Section 2.3 ), which require additional pointers.
Variable length arrays win in space requirements by avoiding the
overhead for pointers and in time requirements because their use of
contiguous memory increases speed on modern
processors with memory caches.  Extra pointers can in practice be encoded
into the lists as offsets.  If updates are relatively infrequent,
variable length arrays will be more compact and faster to traverse.
We can also use a hybrid scheme with a linked list of fixed
length arrays for each term.  When postings lists are stored on disk,
they are stored (perhaps compressed) as a contiguous run of postings
without explicit pointers (as in Figure 1.3 ), so as
to minimize the size of the postings list and the number of disk seeks to
read a postings list into memory.


Exercises.

Draw the inverted index that would be built for the following document collection.  (See Figure 1.3  for an example.)

Doc 1    new home sales top forecasts 
Doc 2    home sales rise in july 
Doc 3    increase in home sales in july 
Doc 4    july new home sales rise




  
Consider these documents:

Doc 1    breakthrough drug for schizophrenia
Doc 2    new schizophrenia drug
Doc 3    new approach for treatment of schizophrenia
Doc 4    new hopes for schizophrenia patients



Draw the term-document incidence matrix for this document
  collection.

Draw the inverted index representation for this
  collection, as in Figure 1.3 (page ).




For the document collection shown in
Exercise 1.2 , what are the returned results for
these queries:


schizophrenia AND drug

for AND NOT(drug OR approach)
