The search user experience
 
It is crucial that we understand the users of web search as well. This is again a significant change from traditional information retrieval, where users were typically professionals with at least some training in the art of phrasing queries over a well-authored collection whose style and structure they understood well. In contrast, web search users tend to not know (or care) about the heterogeneity of web content, the syntax of query languages and the art of phrasing queries; indeed, a mainstream tool (as web search has come to become) should not place such onerous demands on billions of people. A range of studies has concluded that the average number of keywords in a web search is somewhere between 2 and 3. Syntax operators (Boolean connectives, wildcards, etc.) are seldom used, again a result of the composition of the audience - ``normal'' people, not information scientists.


It is clear that the more user traffic a web search engine can attract, the more revenue it stands to earn from sponsored search. How do search engines differentiate themselves and grow their traffic? Here Google identified two principles that helped it grow at the expense of its competitors: (1) a focus on relevance, specifically precision rather than recall in the first few results; (2) a user experience that is lightweight, meaning that both the search query page and the search results page are uncluttered and almost entirely textual, with very few graphical elements. The effect of the first was simply to save users time in locating the information they sought. The effect of the second is to provide a user experience that is extremely responsive, or at any rate not bottlenecked by the time to load the search query or results page.
