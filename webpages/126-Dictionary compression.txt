Dictionary compression


This section presents a series of dictionary data structures
that achieve increasingly higher compression ratios. The
dictionary is small compared with the postings file as 
suggested by Table 5.1 .
So why compress it if it is
responsible for only a small percentage of the overall space
requirements of the IR system?


One of the primary factors in determining the
response time of an IR system is the number of disk seeks necessary to
process a query. If parts of the dictionary are on disk,
then many more disk seeks are necessary in query evaluation.
Thus, the main goal of compressing the dictionary is to fit it in
main memory, or at least a large portion of it, to
support high query throughput.  
Although dictionaries of very large
collections fit into the memory of a standard
desktop machine, this is not true of many other application
scenarios.  For example, an enterprise search server for a
large corporation may have to index a multiterabyte
collection with a comparatively large vocabulary because of
the presence of documents in many different languages.  We
also want to be able to design search systems for limited
hardware such as mobile phones and onboard computers. Other
reasons for wanting to conserve memory are fast startup time
and having to share resources with other applications. The
search system on your PC must get along with the
memory-hogging word processing suite you are using at the
same time.
