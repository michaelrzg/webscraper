Separate feature spaces for document zones.
 There are two
strategies that can be used for document zones.  Above we upweighted
words that appear in certain zones.  This means that we are using the
same features (that is, parameters are 
   
across
different zones), but we pay more attention to the occurrence of terms
in particular zones.  An alternative strategy is to have a completely
separate set of features and corresponding parameters for words
occurring in different zones.  This is in principle more powerful: a
word could usually indicate the topic Middle East when in the
title but Commodities when in the body of a document.  But, in
practice, tying parameters is usually more successful.  Having
separate feature sets means having two or more times as many
parameters, many of which will be much more sparsely seen in the
training data, and hence with worse estimates, whereas upweighting has
no bad effects of this sort.  Moreover, it is quite uncommon for words
to have different preferences when appearing in different zones; it is
mainly the strength of their vote that should be adjusted.
Nevertheless, ultimately this is a contingent result, depending on the
nature and quantity of the training data.
