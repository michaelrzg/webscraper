The Bernoulli model


There are two different ways we can set up an NB
classifier. The model we introduced in the previous section
is the
 multinomial model . It generates one term from the
vocabulary in each position of the document, where we assume
a generative model that will be discussed in more detail in
Section 13.4 
(see also
page 12.1.1 ).


An alternative to the multinomial model
is the 
 multivariate Bernoulli model  
or
 Bernoulli model . It is equivalent to the
binary independence model
of Section 11.3 (page ), which generates an
indicator for each term of the vocabulary, either 
 indicating presence of the term in
the document
or 
indicating absence.  Figure 13.3  presents training and
testing algorithms for the Bernoulli model. The Bernoulli model
has the same time complexity as the multinomial model.






The different generation models imply different estimation
strategies and different classification rules. The Bernoulli model estimates

 as the fraction of documents of
class  that contain term  (Figure 13.3 ,
TRAINBERNOULLINB, line 8).  In contrast, the
multinomial model estimates 
 as the
fraction of tokens or fraction of positions in
documents of class  that contain term 
(Equation 119).  
When classifying a test document, the
Bernoulli model uses binary occurrence information, ignoring
the number of occurrences, whereas the multinomial model
keeps track of multiple occurrences. As a result, the
Bernoulli model typically makes many mistakes when
classifying long documents. For example, it may assign an
entire book to the class China because of a single
occurrence of the term China.


The models also differ in how nonoccurring terms are used
in classification. They do not affect the classification
decision in the multinomial model; but in the Bernoulli model
the probability of nonoccurrence is factored in when
computing  (Figure 13.3 , APPLYBERNOULLINB, Line 7).  This is because only the
Bernoulli NB model models absence of terms explicitly.


Worked example. Applying the Bernoulli model to
the example in Table 13.1 , we have the same estimates
for the priors as before:

,

. The conditional probabilities are:








The denominators are  and  because 
there are three documents in  and one document in 
and because 
the constant  in
Equation 119 is 2 - there are two cases to consider for
each term, occurrence and nonoccurrence.


The scores of the
test document for the two classes are 





and, analogously,





Thus,
the classifier assigns the test document to 

not-China.
When looking only at binary occurrence and not at term
frequency,
Japan and Tokyo are indicators for  ()
and the conditional probabilities of
Chinese for  and  are not different enough
(4/5 vs. 2/3) to affect the classification decision. End worked example.
