Parametric and zone indexes


We have thus far viewed a document as a sequence of terms. In fact, most documents have additional structure. Digital documents generally encode, in machine-recognizable form, certain  metadata  associated with each document. By metadata, we mean specific forms of data about a document, such as its author(s), title and date of publication.  This metadata would generally include  fields  such as the date of creation and the format of the document, as well the author and possibly the title of the document. The possible values of a field should be thought of as finite - for instance, the set of all dates of authorship.


Consider queries of the form ``find documents authored by
William Shakespeare in 1601, containing the phrase
alas poor Yorick''. Query processing then consists as
usual of postings intersections, except that we may merge
postings from standard inverted as well as

 parametric indexes . There is one parametric index for each field (say, date of creation); it allows us to select only the documents matching a date specified in the query. Figure 6.1  illustrates the user's view of such a parametric search. Some of the fields may assume ordered values, such as dates; in the example query above, the year 1601 is one such field value. The search engine may support querying ranges on such ordered values; to this end, a structure like a B-tree may be used for the field's dictionary.




Parametric search.In this example we have a collection with fields allowing us to select publications by zones such as Author and fields such as Language.



 Zones  are similar to fields, except the
contents of a zone can be arbitrary free text. Whereas a
field may take on a relatively small set of values, a zone
can be thought of as an arbitrary, unbounded amount of
text. For instance, document titles and abstracts are
generally treated as zones. We may build a separate
inverted
index for each zone of a document, to support queries such
as ``find documents with merchant in the title and
william in the author list and the phrase
gentle rain in the body''. This has the effect of
building an index that looks like
Figure 6.2.  Whereas the dictionary for a
parametric index comes from a fixed vocabulary (the set of
languages, or the set of dates), the dictionary for a zone
index must structure whatever vocabulary stems from the text
of that zone.






In fact, we can reduce the size of the dictionary by encoding the zone in which a term occurs in the postings. In Figure 6.3 for instance, we show how occurrences of william in the title and author zones of various documents are encoded. Such an encoding is useful when the size of the dictionary is a concern (because we require the dictionary to fit in main memory). But there is another important reason why the encoding of Figure 6.3 is useful: the efficient computation of scores using a technique we will call  weighted zone scoring .




Figure 6.3:
Zone index in which the zone is encoded in the postings rather than the dictionary.
