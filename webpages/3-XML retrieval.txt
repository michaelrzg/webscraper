XML retrieval


Information retrieval systems are often contrasted with
relational databases. Traditionally, IR systems have retrieved information from
unstructured text - by which we mean ``raw'' text
without markup. Databases are designed for querying
relational data: sets of records that have values for
predefined attributes such as employee number, title and
salary.  There are fundamental differences between
information retrieval and database systems in terms of
retrieval model, data structures and query language as shown
in Table 10.1 .

RDB (relational database) search, unstructured
  information retrieval and
structured information retrieval.
There is no consensus yet as to which 
methods work best for
structured
retrieval although many researchers believe that XQuery
(page 10.5 )
will become the standard for structured queries.

 



Some highly structured text search problems are most
efficiently handled by
a relational database, for example, if the
employee table contains an attribute for short textual job
descriptions and you want to find all employees who are
involved with invoicing.  In this case, the SQL query:

select lastname from employees where job_desc like 'invoic%';

may be sufficient to satisfy your information need with high
precision and recall.


However, many structured data sources containing text
are best modeled as structured documents rather than
relational data.  We call the search over such structured
documents   structured retrieval . Queries in
structured retrieval can be either structured or
unstructured, but we will assume in this chapter that the
collection consists only of structured documents.
Applications of
structured retrieval include  digital
libraries ,  patent databases ,   , text in which
entities  like persons and locations have been tagged
(in a process called 
  )
and output from office
suites like OpenOffice that save documents as marked up
text. In all of these applications, we want to be able to
run queries that combine textual criteria with structural
criteria.
Examples of such queries are
give me a full-length article on fast fourier
  transforms (digital libraries),
give me patents whose claims mention RSA public key
  encryption and that cite US patent 4,405,829 (patents), or
give me articles about sightseeing tours of 
the Vatican and the Coliseum (entity-tagged text).
These three queries are  structured queries that
cannot be answered well by an unranked retrieval system. As we argued in
westlaw unranked retrieval models like the
Boolean model suffer from low recall.
For instance, an unranked system would return a
potentially large number of articles that mention
the Vatican, the Coliseum and sightseeing tours without ranking the ones that are most
relevant for the query first. Most users are also
notoriously bad at precisely stating structural
constraints. For instance, users may not know for which
structured elements the search system supports search.
In our
example, the user may be unsure whether to issue the query
as sightseeing AND
(COUNTRY:Vatican
OR
LANDMARK:Coliseum)
, as
sightseeing AND
(STATE:Vatican
OR
BUILDING:Coliseum)
 or in some other form.
Users may also be completely unfamiliar with structured search and
advanced search interfaces or unwilling to use them.
In this chapter, we look at how ranked retrieval methods
can be adapted to structured
documents to address these problems.


We will only look at one standard for encoding structured documents:
 Extensible Markup Language 
or  XML , which is
currently the most widely used such standard.
We will not cover
the specifics that distinguish XML from other types of markup
such as HTML and SGML. But most of what we say in this
chapter is applicable to
markup languages in general.


In the context of information retrieval, we are only
interested in XML as a language for encoding text and
documents. A perhaps more widespread use of
XML is to encode non-text data. For example, we may want to
export data in XML format from an enterprise
resource planning system and then read them into an
analytics program to produce graphs for a presentation.
This type of application of XML is called
 data-centric 
because
 numerical and
non-text attribute-value data dominate and text is usually a small
fraction of the overall data. Most data-centric XML is
stored in databases - in contrast to the
inverted index-based methods for text-centric XML that we present in this chapter.


We call XML retrieval 
structured retrieval in this chapter.  Some
researchers prefer the term  semistructured retrieval 
to distinguish XML retrieval from database querying.  We
have adopted the terminology that is widespread in the XML
retrieval community.  For instance, the standard way of
referring to XML queries is  structured queries , not  semistructured queries .  The
term structured retrieval is rarely used for database
querying and it always refers to XML retrieval in this book.


There is a second type of information retrieval problem that
is intermediate between unstructured retrieval and querying
a relational database: parametric and zone search, which
we discussed in Section 6.1 (page ).  In the data
model of parametric and zone search, there are 
parametric fields (relational attributes
like date or file-size) and
zones - text attributes that
each take a chunk of unstructured text as value, e.g.,
author and title in
Figure 6.1 (page ).
The data model is
flat, that is, there is no nesting of attributes. 
The number of attributes is small.
In
contrast, XML documents have the more complex tree structure
that we see in Figure 10.2  in which attributes are
nested. The number of attributes and nodes is greater than
in parametric and zone search.


After presenting the basic concepts of XML in Section 10.1 ,
this chapter first discusses the challenges we face in
XML retrieval (Section 10.2 ). Next we describe a
vector space model for XML retrieval (Section 10.3 ).
Section 10.4  presents INEX, a shared task evaluation that
has been held for a number of years and currently is the
most important venue for XML retrieval research.
We discuss the differences between data-centric and
text-centric approaches to XML in Section 10.5 .
