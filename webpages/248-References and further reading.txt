References and further reading
 
There are many good introductions to XML, including
(Harold and Means, 2004). Table 10.1  is inspired by a similar
table in (van Rijsbergen, 1979).
Section 10.4  follows the overview of INEX 2002 by
Gövert and Kazai (2003), published in the proceedings of
the meeting (Fuhr et al., 2003a). The proceedings of the four
following INEX meetings were published as
Fuhr et al. (2003b), Fuhr et al. (2005), Fuhr et al. (2006), and Fuhr et al. (2007). An uptodate overview article is Fuhr and Lalmas (2007).
The results in Table 10.4  are from (Kamps et al., 2006).
Chu-Carroll et al. (2006) also present evidence that XML
queries increase precision compared with
unstructured queries.
Instead of coverage and relevance, INEX now evaluates on the
related but different dimensions of
exhaustivity and specificity
(Lalmas and Tombros, 2007). Trotman et al. (2006) relate the tasks
investigated at INEX to real world uses of structured
retrieval such as structured book search on internet
bookstore sites.


The structured document retrieval principle is due to
Chiaramella et al. (1996).
Figure 10.5  is from (Fuhr and Großjohann, 2004). 
Rahm and Bernstein (2001) give a survey of automatic schema
matching that is applicable to XML. The vector-space based XML retrieval method in
Section 10.3  is essentially IBM Haifa's JuruXML system
as presented by Mass et al. (2003) and Carmel et al. (2003).
Schlieder and Meuss (2002) and Grabs and Schek (2002)
describe similar approaches.
Carmel et al. (2003)
represent queries as  XML
fragments . The trees that represent XML queries
in this chapter are all XML fragments, but XML fragments
also permit the operators ,  and
phrase on content nodes.


We chose to present the vector space model for XML retrieval
because it is simple and a natural extension of the
unstructured vector space model in Chapter 6 .
But many other unstructured retrieval methods have been
applied to XML retrieval with at least as much success as
the vector space model. These methods include language
models (cf. Chapter 12 , e.g.,
Kamps et al. (2004), Ogilvie and Callan (2005), List et al. (2005)),
systems that use a relational database as a
backend (Theobald et al., 2008;2005, Mihajlovic et al., 2005),
probabilistic weighting (Lu et al., 2007), and fusion
(Larson, 2005).  There is currently no consensus as
to what the best approach to XML retrieval is.


Most early work on XML retrieval accomplished relevance
ranking by focusing on individual terms, including their structural
contexts,  in query and document.
As in unstructured information retrieval, there is a trend
in more recent work
to model relevance ranking as combining evidence from
disparate measurements about the query, the document and
their match. The combination function can be tuned manually
(Sigurbjörnsson et al., 2004, Arvola et al., 2005)
or trained using machine learning methods
(Vittaut and Gallinari (2006), cf. mls).


An active area of XML retrieval
research is  focused retrieval 
(Trotman et al., 2007), which aims to avoid returning
nested elements that share one or more common subelements
(cf. discussion in Section 10.2 ,
page 10.2 ).  
There is evidence that users dislike redundancy caused by
nested elements
(Betsi et al., 2006).
Focused retrieval requires evaluation
measures that penalize redundant results lists
(Kazai and Lalmas, 2006, Lalmas et al., 2007).
Trotman and Geva (2006) argue that XML retrieval is a form
of  passage retrieval .
In passage retrieval (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997, Salton et al., 1993, Hearst and Plaunt, 1993, Hearst, 1997, Zobel et al., 1995),
the retrieval system returns short
passages instead of documents in response to a user
query. While element boundaries in XML documents are cues
for identifying good segment boundaries between passages,
the most relevant passage often does not coincide with an
XML element.


In the last several years, the query format at INEX has been
the NEXI standard proposed by
Trotman and Sigurbjörnsson (2004).
Figure 10.3  is from their paper.
O'Keefe and Trotman (2004) give evidence that
users cannot reliably distinguish the child and descendant
axes. This justifies only permitting descendant axes in 
NEXI (and
XML
fragments).  These structural constraints were only
treated as ``hints'' in recent INEXes. Assessors can judge
an element highly relevant even though it violates one of
the structural constraints specified in a NEXI query.


An
alternative to structured query languages like NEXI is a more sophisticated user
interface for query formulation
(Tannier and Geva, 2005, van Zwol, 2006, Woodley and Geva, 2006).


A broad overview of XML retrieval that covers database as well
as IR approaches is given by Amer-Yahia and Lalmas (2006) and an
extensive reference list on the topic can be found in
(Amer-Yahia et al., 2005). Chapter 6 of
Grossman and Frieder (2004) is a good introduction
to structured text retrieval from a database perspective.
The proposed standard for XQuery is available at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/ including an
extension for full-text queries (Amer-Yahia et al., 2006):
http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-full-text/.
Work that has
looked at combining the relational database and the
unstructured information retrieval approaches includes
(Fuhr and Rölleke, 1997), (Navarro and Baeza-Yates, 1997),
(Cohen, 1998), and (Chaudhuri et al., 2006).
