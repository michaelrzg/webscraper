Review of basic probability theory


We hope that the reader has seen a little basic probability
theory previously.  We will give a very quick review; some
references for further reading appear at the end of the
chapter. A variable  represents an event (a subset of the
space of possible outcomes).  Equivalently, we can represent
the subset via a  random
variable  , which is a function from
outcomes to real numbers; the subset is the domain over which
the random variable  has a particular
value. 
Often we
will not know with certainty whether an event is true in the
world.  We can ask the probability of the event 
. For two events  and , the
joint event of both events occurring is described by the joint probability
. The conditional probability  expresses
the probability of event  given that event  occurred.
The fundamental relationship between joint and
conditional probabilities is given by the  chain
rule :






(56)


Without making any assumptions, the probability of a joint event equals the probability of one of the events multiplied by the probability of the other event conditioned on knowing the first event happened.


Writing 
 for the complement of an event, we similarly have:






(57)


Probability theory also has a  partition rule , which says that if an event  can be divided into an exhaustive set of disjoint subcases, then the probability of  is the sum of the probabilities of the subcases.  A special case of this rule gives that:






(58)



From these we can derive  Bayes' Rule  for inverting conditional probabilities:






(59)


This equation can also be thought of as a way of updating probabilities.  We start off with an initial estimate of how likely the event  is when we do not have any other information; this is the  prior probability .  Bayes' rule lets us derive a  posterior probability  after having seen the evidence , based on the  likelihood  of  occurring in the two cases that  does or does not hold.

Finally, it is often useful to talk about the  odds  of an event, which provide a kind of multiplier for how probabilities change:
