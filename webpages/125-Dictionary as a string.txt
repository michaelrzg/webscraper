Dictionary as a string

The simplest data structure for the dictionary is to 
sort the vocabulary lexicographically and store it
in an array
of fixed-width entries as shown in
Figure 5.3 . 
Assuming a Unicode representation, we
allocate We allocate 20
bytes for the term itself (because few
terms have more than twenty characters in English), 4 bytes for
its document frequency, and 4 bytes for the pointer to its postings
list. Four-byte pointers resolve a 4 gigabytes (GB) address space. For
large collections like the web, we need to allocate more
bytes per pointer.  We look up terms in the array by binary
search.


For Reuters-RCV1, we need 





for storing
the dictionary in this scheme.




Dictionary-as-a-string storage.Pointers mark
the end of the preceding term and the beginning of the
next. For example, the first three terms in this example
are systile, syzygetic,
and syzygial.




Using fixed-width entries for terms is clearly wasteful. The
average length of a term in English is about eight
characters icompresstb1, so on average we are wasting twelve characters 
(or
24 bytes) 
in
the fixed-width scheme. Also, we have no way of storing terms with
more than twenty characters like
hydrochlorofluorocarbons
and
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
We can
overcome these
shortcomings
by storing the dictionary terms as one long string
of characters, as shown in Figure 5.4 . The
pointer to the next term is also used to demarcate the end
of the current term. As before, we locate terms in the data
structure by way of binary search in the (now smaller) table. This scheme saves us 60%
compared to fixed-width storage - 


24 bytes on average of
the 40 bytes 

12 bytes on average of
the 20 bytes 

we allocated for terms before. However, we now
also need to store  term pointers. The term
pointers resolve 
 positions, so they
need to be 
 bits or 3 bytes long.


In this new scheme, 
we need 

 for
the Reuters-RCV1 dictionary:
4 bytes each for frequency and postings
pointer, 3 bytes for the term pointer, and 
 bytes on
average for the term. 
So we have reduced the space requirements
by one third from 19.211.2 to 10.87.6 MB.




Blocked storage with four terms per block.The
first block consists of 
systile,
syzygetic,
syzygial, and syzygy with lengths of
seven, nine, eight, and six characters, respectively. Each term is preceded
by a byte encoding its length that
indicates how many bytes
to skip to reach subsequent terms.
