Sublinear tf scaling

It seems unlikely that twenty occurrences of a term in a document truly carry twenty times the significance of a single occurrence. Accordingly, there has been considerable research into variants of term frequency that go beyond counting the number of occurrences of a term. A common modification is to use instead the logarithm of the term frequency, which assigns a weight given by








(28)



In this form, we may replace  by some other function  as in (28), to obtain:
 





(29)


Equation (23) can then be modified by replacing tf-idf by wf-idf as defined in (29).
