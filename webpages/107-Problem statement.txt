Problem statement
 
We can define the goal in hard flat clustering as follows.
Given (i)
a set of documents  
, (ii)
a desired number of clusters , and (iii) an  objective
function  that evaluates the quality of a clustering, 
we want to compute
an assignment 

that minimizes (or, in other cases, maximizes) the objective
function. In most cases, we also demand that  is
surjective, i.e., that none of the  clusters is empty.


The objective function is often defined in terms of
similarity or distance between documents. Below, we will see
that the objective in  -means clustering is to minimize the average distance
between documents and their centroids or, equivalently, to
maximize the similarity between documents and their centroids.
The discussion of similarity measures and distance metrics
in Chapter 14  (page 14.1 ) also
applies to
this chapter. As in 
Chapter 14 , we use both similarity and distance
to talk about relatedness between documents.


For documents, the type of similarity we want is usually
topic similarity or high values on the same dimensions in
the vector space model. For example, documents about China
have high values on dimensions like Chinese,
Beijing, and Mao whereas documents about the
UK tend to have high values for London,
Britain and Queen. We approximate topic
similarity with cosine similarity or Euclidean distance in
vector space (Chapter 6 ).  If we intend to
capture 
similarity of a type other than topic, for example,
similarity of language, then a
different representation may be appropriate.  When computing
topic similarity, stop words can be safely ignored, but they
are important cues for separating clusters of English (in
which the occurs frequently and la
infrequently) and French documents (in which the
occurs infrequently and la frequently).
