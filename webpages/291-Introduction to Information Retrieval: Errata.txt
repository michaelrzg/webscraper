CORRECTIONS MADE IN THE 2ND PRINTING OF IIR

FRONT MATTER

p.xix Insert in list of Acknowledgments in the paragraph beginning "We are very grateful ..."
       Björn Andrist
       Miklós Erdélyi
       Marek Kowalkiewicz
       Karthik Raghunathan

p.xx Insert in list of Acknowledgments in the paragraph beginning "Many people gave us ..."
       Valentin I. Spitkovsky

CHAPTER 3

p.48, end of 3rd paragraph "A walk down the reverse B-tree then enumerates all terms $R$ in the vocabulary with
       a given prefix." Should be "A walk down the reverse B-tree then enumerates
       all terms $R$ in the vocabulary with a given postfix."
p.48, towards end of 4th paragraph Immediately before the sentence "Finally, we use the standard ...",
       insert the following new sentence: We scan and filter out any terms that match the prefix as well as
       the suffix because these two strings overlap (for instance, the query
       \query{ba*ba} would result in the term \term{ba} being in $W\cap R$; this
       would be filtered out).  FIXING THIS ALSO CHANGED p.49 OF PRINTED BOOK.

p.55, line 2: "given a set ${\cal S}$ of strings" should be "given a set $V$ of strings"

CHAPTER 6

pp.100-123: Throughout Chapter 6, change all occurrences of "non-relevant" to "nonrelevant".
       

p.103, line 5: "maps the presence of query terms in a zone to ${0,1}$."
       should be "maps the presence of query terms in a zone to $\{0,1\}$." i.e.,
       the curly braces should be made to print.

p.115, lines 9-10: "When the scores are finally computed in Step 11, all that remains
       in Step 12 is to pick off the $K$ documents with the highest scores." should
       be "When the scores are finally computed in Step 9, all that remains in Step
       10 is to pick off the $K$ documents with the highest scores."
p.115, line 17: "it seems appear necessary to store" - delete "appear"

CHAPTER 7

p.125, Figure 7.1, line 5: \mbox{calculate }\mbox{w}_{t,q}\mbox{ and fetch postings list for }t\\
       Should be \mbox{ fetch postings list for }t\\
p.125, line 5: "with line 8 altered since we take" should be "with line 7 altered since we take"

p.132, line 13: "A common solution to this issue is the user of" should be "A

p.134 "Rank them by vector space ..." should be "Rank the results by vector space ..."

CHAPTER 10

p.191, figure 10.10, lower the starting point of the three arrows
       (the starting point should be on the lower line of
       the box, not in the box)

       (its end position should be at
       about 50% of the second box)

P(R=1|d')

p.209, numbered item 3:  Replace the last two lines of text starting
after "empirically" so it reads:
not observed empirically: as might be expected, $p_t$ is shown to rise

his data analysis, a plausible proposal would be to use the estimate
$p_t =\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}\docf_t/N$.
