Summary


Relevance feedback has been shown to be very effective at improving
relevance of results. Its successful use requires queries for which the
set of relevant documents is medium to large.
Full relevance feedback is often onerous for the user, and its
implementation is not very efficient in most IR systems.
In many cases, other types of interactive retrieval may improve
relevance by about as much with less work.


Beyond the core ad hoc retrieval scenario, other uses of relevance feedback include:


Following a changing information need (e.g., names of car models
  of interest change over time)

Maintaining an information filter (e.g., for a news feed). Such
  filters are discussed further in Chapter 13 .

Active learning (deciding which examples it is most useful to know
  the class of to reduce annotation costs).



Exercises.

Under what conditions would the modified query
 in Equation 49 be the same as the
original query ? In all other cases, is  closer
than  to the centroid of the relevant documents?



Why is positive feedback likely to be more useful than
negative feedback to an IR system? Why might only using one
nonrelevant document be more effective than using several?



Suppose that a user's initial query is
cheap CDs cheap DVDs extremely cheap CDs. The user
examines two documents,  and . She judges ,
with the content CDs cheap software cheap CDs
relevant and 
with content cheap thrills DVDs
nonrelevant.
Assume that we are using direct term frequency (with no
scaling and no document frequency). There is no need to
length-normalize vectors. Using Rocchio relevance feedback
as in Equation 49 what would the revised query vector be after relevance
feedback? Assume 
.



Omar has implemented a relevance feedback web search system, where he is going to do relevance feedback based only on words in the title text returned for a page (for efficiency). The user is going to rank 3 results. The first user, Jinxing, queries for:

banana slug


and the top three titles returned are:

banana slug Ariolimax columbianus

Santa Cruz mountains banana slug 

Santa Cruz Campus Mascot


Jinxing judges the first two documents relevant, and the third nonrelevant.  Assume that Omar's search engine uses term frequency but no length normalization nor IDF. Assume that he is using the Rocchio relevance feedback mechanism, with 
.
Show the final revised query that would be run. (Please list the vector elements in alphabetical order.)
