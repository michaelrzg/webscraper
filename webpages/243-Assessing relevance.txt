Assessing relevance


To properly evaluate a system, your 
test information needs must be germane to the documents in the test
document collection, and appropriate for predicted usage of the system.  These
information needs are best designed by domain experts.  Using random
combinations of
query terms as an information need is generally not a good idea because
typically they will not resemble the actual distribution of
information needs. 


Given information needs and documents, you need to collect relevance
assessments.  This is a time-consuming and expensive process involving
human beings.  For tiny collections like Cranfield, exhaustive
judgments of relevance for each query and document pair were
obtained.  For large modern collections, it is usual for relevance to
be assessed only for a subset of the documents for each query.
The most standard approach is  pooling , where relevance is
assessed over a subset of the collection that is
formed from the top  documents returned by a number of different IR
systems (usually the ones to be evaluated),
and perhaps other sources such as the results of Boolean keyword searches or
documents found by expert searchers in an interactive process.

A human is not a device that reliably reports a gold
standard judgment of relevance of a document to a query.  Rather,
humans and their relevance judgments are quite idiosyncratic and
variable.  But this is not a problem to be solved: in the final
analysis, the success of an IR system depends on how good it is at
satisfying the needs of these idiosyncratic humans, one information
need at a time.


Nevertheless, it is interesting to consider and measure how much
agreement between judges there is on relevance judgments.
In the social sciences, a common measure for agreement between judges is
the  kappa statistic .  It is designed for categorical judgments and
corrects a simple agreement rate for the rate of chance agreement.

where  is the proportion of the times the judges agreed, and 
is the proportion of the times they would be expected to agree by chance.
There are choices in how the latter is estimated: if we simply say we are
making a two-class decision and assume nothing more, then the expected chance
agreement rate is 0.5.  
However, normally the class distribution assigned is skewed, and it is usual to use

 marginal 
statistics to 
calculate expected agreement.There are still two ways to do it depending on whether one pools the marginal distribution across judges or uses the marginals for each judge separately; both forms have been used, but we present the pooled version because it is more conservative in the presence of systematic differences in assessments across judges.
The calculations are shown in Table 8.2 .
The kappa value will be 1 if two judges always agree, 0 if they agree
only at the rate given by chance, and negative if they are worse than
random.  If there are more than two judges, it is normal to calculate
an average pairwise kappa value.  As a rule of thumb, a kappa value
above 0.8 is taken as good agreement, a kappa value between 0.67 and
0.8 is taken as fair agreement, and agreement below 0.67 is seen as data
providing a dubious basis for an evaluation, though the precise cutoffs
depend on the purposes for which the data will be used.


Interjudge agreement of relevance has been measured within the TREC
evaluations and for medical IR collections.  Using
the above rules of thumb, the level of agreement normally falls in the
range of ``fair'' (0.67-0.8).
The fact that human agreement on a binary relevance
judgment is quite modest is one reason for not requiring more
fine-grained relevance labeling from the test set creator.
To answer the question of whether
IR evaluation results are valid despite the variation of individual
assessors' judgments, people have experimented with evaluations taking
one or the other of two judges' opinions as the gold standard.
The choice can make a considerable absolute 
difference to reported scores, but has in general been found to have
little impact on the relative effectiveness ranking of either different systems or
variants of a single system which are being compared for effectiveness.
