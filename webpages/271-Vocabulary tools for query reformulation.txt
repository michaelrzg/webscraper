Vocabulary tools for query reformulation


Various user supports in the search process can help the
user see how their searches are or are not working. This includes
information about words that were omitted from the query
because they were on stop lists, what words were stemmed to, the number
of hits on each term or phrase, and whether words were dynamically
turned into phrases. The IR system might also suggest
search terms by means of a thesaurus or a controlled vocabulary. A
user can also be allowed to browse lists of the terms that are in the
inverted index, and thus find good terms that appear in the collection.
