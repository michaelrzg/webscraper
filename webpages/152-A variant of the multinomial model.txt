A variant of the multinomial model
 
An alternative formalization of the 
  
represents each document  as an -dimensional vector of counts


where 
 is the term frequency of  in .

 is then computed as follows
(cf. Equation 99, page 12.2.1 );






(129)


Note that we have omitted the
multinomial factor. See Equation 99 (page 99 ).


Equation 129  is equivalent to the sequence model in
Equation 113 as 

 for terms that do not occur in 
(
) and
a term that occurs 
 times will contribute 

factors both in Equation 113
and in Equation 129.


Exercises.

Which of the documents in
Table 13.5  have identical and different bag of
words representations for (i) the Bernoulli model (ii) the
multinomial model? If there are differences, describe them.



The rationale for the positional independence
assumption is that there is no useful information in the
fact that a term occurs in position  of a document.  Find
exceptions. Consider formulaic documents with a fixed
document structure.



Table 13.3  gives Bernoulli and
multinomial estimates for the word the. Explain the
difference.
